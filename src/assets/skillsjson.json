The present, I have extensive experience with frontend design as I have created multiple web projects and email templates. I can use CSS tags to improve designs. I believe in using the DRY method when designing with CSS for reusability and maintainability. I really understood Javascript when I was studying about React. I usually use raw javascript when creating e-mail templates.",

This Web site is actually made with React and Semantic UI as a way to show you how extensive I know the language. Along with React, I used GraphQL so that to make our API more manageable. It has been great to use and it made our lives easier. We used python with flask and graphene library for the api server.",
